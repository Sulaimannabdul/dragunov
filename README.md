## ~Ghidra Software~ Reverse Engineering Framework

Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and maintained by the 
[National Security Agency][nsa] Research Directorate. This framework includes a suite of 
full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a 
variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include `disassembly,` 
`assembly,` `decompilation,` `graphing,` `scripting,` along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra 
supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both 
user interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra extension components 
and/or scripts using Java or Python.

Dragunov projects come for Improving the disassembly and decompilation, this can be helpful if a register is used to store a global
variable. Additionally, it can sometimes be helpful to set register values when trying to understand a function.
